# PyBer Analysis
This study was built from the analysis of ride-sharing fares, riders, and drivers by type of city (i.e., rural, suburban, and urban), with January 1st-May 8th, 2019 serving as the snapshot in time. With this information, PyBer aims to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
The "Results" and "Summary" sections provide a detailed summary of how the ride-sharing data differs by city type and how those differences can be utilized by PyBer stakeholders.

### Results
The following results describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types, including the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

  #### Rural
  The rural city type has the least amount of rides, drivers, and total fares. At 125 total rides and 78 total drivers, the rural cities used ride-sharing services an average of ~30 rides and ~20 drivers per month over the four-month period. The total proportion of rides to drivers is 3:2. The total fares equate to $4,327, calculating to an average of ~$1,100 total fares per month. Although the total riders, drivers, and fares are quite low compared to suburban and urban city types, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver are highest in the rural cities (average fare per ride is $34.92, and average fare per driver is $55.49). In summation, although rural cities on average have the lowest amount of rides, the average fare per ride and per driver is much greater when compared to other city types, which might make rural city types more desirable to drivers. 

  #### Suburban
   At 625 total rides and 490 total drivers, the rural cities used ride-sharing services an average of ~155 rides and ~120 drivers per month over the four-month period. The total proportion of rides to drivers is ~3:2. The total fares equate to $19,356, calculating to an average of ~$5,000 total fares per month. The average fare per ride and average fare per driver are $30.97 and $39.50, respectively. In summation, suburban city types on average have a greater proportion of rides to drivers and the average fare per ride and per driver is relatively high, which might make suburban city types more desirable to drivers.

  #### Urban
  The urban city type has the greatest amount of rides, drivers, and total fares. At 1,625 total rides and 2,405 total drivers, the rural cities used ride-sharing services an average of ~400 rides and ~600 drivers per month over the four-month period. The total proportion of rides to drivers is 2:3. The total fares equate to $39,854, calculating to an average of ~$10,000 total fares per month. Although the total riders, drivers, and fares are greater than the other city types, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver are the lowest in urban cities (average fare per ride is $24.53, and average fare per driver is $16.57). In summation, although urban cities on average have the greatest amount of rides, the average fare per ride and per driver is much lower when compared to other city types. Paired with the fact that there are more drivers than rides on average, urban cities may be less desirable to drivers and more desirable to riders.


### Summary
The following summary serves to provide three businesss recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

  #### Incentives for Riders
  To increase the number of rides and improve access to ride-sharing services in underserved neighborhoods in all city types, incentives should be instilled that benefits riders (monetarily or otherwise) when they sign up for the ride-sharing service. To improve affordability for riders, discounts and other rewards should also be given when riders reach a certain number of rides.

  #### Incentives for Drivers
  To improve access in underserved neighborhoods in all city types, incentives must also be rewarded to drivers. As some neighborhoods are likely underserved due to their locale, drivers should be reimbursed by PyBer for every mile that they drive. This will help drivers in urban city types to increase the number of riders and help even out the 3:2 driver-to-ride dispropotion.

  #### Improve Affordability in Rural + Suburban City Types
  To help improve affordability in rural and suburban cities, and thus increase accessibility in underserved neighborhoods, a rewards program between PyBer and local companies should be created so that riders are rewarded through means other than strictly using the ride-sharing application. This would be a great opportunity to advertise the ride-sharing services within the local community.
